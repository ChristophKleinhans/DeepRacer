# What we did so far
- We calculated the perfect raceline and told him to hold the raceline as good as possible
- We told him to take the maximum speed in relation to the steering angle
- We told him to make less steering steps and more progress

# What we learned
- Having the perfect raceline is not the best to do, because he is trying to do the raceline but dont risk anything and doesnt speed up as needed
- We have to let him find by himself the maximum speed - he automatically tries to avoid slipping
- Maybe the reward function should be a lot simpler - don't steer so much and make progress is maybe enough

# What shall we do the next time
- Best should be to motivate him just to steer less and make a lot of progress
- And give him also the possibility to drive out of the track and cut the curves
